My name is Dur not Harr.
I am oldest sone of chief Hur yet Harr. Great chief of our clan.
My father died few months ago and my younger brother tried to end my life to become the great chief.
Fortunatelly I have been warned soon enough by my loyal, but still was forced to flee.
My brother could not risk to let me gain my strength in exile and come back for revenge, so he hunts us.
We though they have lost our track, but it seems they catched up with us again.
One of my hunt groups was ambushed and massacred.
We found them when you were away.
This means their force will attack soon.",
