It will give it the right... mushroom taste!

Problem is, that there are no mushroom in close area, besides one cavern.
That cavern is well hidden, but I tell you where to go.

You will leave the village by southern gate and will cross the bridge to the southern side of the river.
Just after you cross the bridge, you will turn left and will walk that way.
You will walk through clearing, so be careful to not stumple over stomp.
At the eastern end of the clearing there are few untouched trees. They are under the rocks, not on them.
Between those trees there is entrance to the cavern.

Inside there are tons of mushrooms for my pie!

I will give you basked so you can carry them comformtably.",
