But it won't be it, since it is unstable and can fall down any time.
It can't be much too far away from that area though.
Wait a minute...
It can not be in the rockies, because there is nowhere to build a camp.
It won't be to the east. The valley is too narrow there and somebody would see them.
North is out of question, since it is where we are at the moment.
So all we have is South and West.
I doubt it will be west, it is too far away and bad terrain.
But he south...
There is river, so they would have easy access to the water.
Now that I think about it. I have seen encampment there about a week ago. But though those were just some travelers.
So, you will leave village to the south through the whole valley, unless you meet another river. And not too far away from the source there should be old camp.
If you won't find it, try to go to the west from there.",
