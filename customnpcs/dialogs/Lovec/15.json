Well since you fell  from that height, I suppose something could happen to you...
So let me tell my part of the story.

Two days ago I was on the hunt. I was stalking a deer in the valley near the river.
Then heard loud bang. Looked at the direction of it and seen you falling from a cliff right into the river.
I dropped everything and ran for you. Got you out. You were uncouncious. I dragged you to our village and then waited for you to wake up.
Be glad I took care of you! I lost my favourite bow because of you!",
