She moved to Ramshorne few years back after our herbalist died.
Nobody knows where exactly is she from, but I think she is from Aramoor.
She saved Lord Musk's hide when he traveled around. He got bad infection, almost sure death. But she managed to keep him alive and cure it somehow. 
That is why he values her so much.
She is kind of a loner. Always deep in her work.

People back in Ramshorne do not like her much, bout I think she does not care.
Only people who talk to her regulary are Carl and me.
She picks dandelions for Carl's horrible meals and tea and I sometimes need something to cure hangover.

Nothing more interesting about her.",
