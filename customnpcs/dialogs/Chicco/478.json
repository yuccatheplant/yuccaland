Chicco's tactics enabled Vehil to take control of Dandarim. Dwarves have fallen back, detonating volatile substance inside of the tunnel. Everybody had to evacuate and Dandarim was destroyed.

After that, Dwarves called truce and soon after that evacuated their cities seeking for new continent to settle on.
People tried to colonise underground cities, but dwarves left lots of traps and bombs in the tunnels.
Mountains remains no man's land to this day.

Chicco returned to Aramoor and later worked himself to the post of Captain.",
