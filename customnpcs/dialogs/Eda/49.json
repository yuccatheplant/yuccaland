Today morning we were expecting supply caravan. But it did not arrived.
We sent out patrols to see what happened. We found the caravan - raided.
It was deserted and no bodies around.
We believe those traders are long time dead, but we need to get their bodies.

Your instructions are:
-Go to the ambush site. It is in those rockies south of here. 
-Take a walk around there and try to find something.

If you figure anything out, do not do anything risky alone. Come to us and tell us what are you planning to do.
Also. I hope you are not squamish, because there is a lot of blood around.
And lastly. Do not go there unarmed. Take this armour and if I were you, I would buy a shield.

Dismissed.",
